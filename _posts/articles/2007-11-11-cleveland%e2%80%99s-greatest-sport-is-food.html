<p><a href="http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=cle">The Indians</a> didn't do it. <a href="http://www.clevelandbrowns.com/">The Browns</a> didn't do it, either.  <a href="http://www.nba.com/cavaliers/">The Cavs</a>? I don't know what's going on there at all.</p>
<p>Cleveland sports franchises come close to taking our city to the championship, but then fall short of going all the way. Well tonight there was a championship and Cleveland finally emerges with a victor!</p>
<p>Congratulations to <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_io/text/0,3180,FOOD_30216_64995,00.html">Chef Michael Symon</a> of the restaurants <a href="http://www.lolabistro.com/">Lola and Lolita</a>. You've done your city proud!</p>
