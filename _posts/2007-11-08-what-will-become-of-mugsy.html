<p>At the November <a href="http://webdesign.meetup.com/396/">Cleveland Web Standards Association</a> meetup, <a href="http://www.colbowdesign.com/">Brad Colbow</a> shared with approximately 40 attendees how he goes about styling a website using <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. He was the third presenter since we started having monthly workshops as a group.</p>
<p>Considering that he was preceded by <a href="http://meyerweb.com/">Eric Meyer</a> and <a href="http://www.jasonmorrison.net/content/">Jason Morrison</a> during earlier meetups, Brad really held his own as a presenter. If you are interested in the content of his presentation, you can <a href="http://colbowdesign.com/blog2/?p=75">view the files</a> at his blog, and read <a href="http://www.kashubeck.com/blog/?p=23">Dana's recap</a>.</p>

<h2>Beyond Brad's Presentation</h2>
<p>What I'm writing about is the November meetup tragedy. <a href="http://www.wileymedia.com/weblog/">Eric Wiley</a> and his faithful friend Mugsy were parted for the first time in 8 years.</p>

<p>It's a heart wrenching tale that continues to unfold about a man and his mug.</p>
<p>The first morning without Mugsy, Eric found himself reflecting on all the joy that Mugsy had brought him in their relationship. As <a href="http://www.rocknrollhell.com/cinderella/">Cinderella</a>'s power ballad so eloquently states, "You don't know what you've got til it's gone."</p>

<p>As bad as I feel for Eric's loss, I find myself far more concerned with Mugsy's well being. Consider what it must be like to</p>
<p>be an abandoned 8 year old mug. He's in unfamiliar surroundings. God only knows who has fondled the slightly dented aluminum exterior! I shudder just thinking about it.</p>
<p>I imagine that the poor little drink dispenser might be so distraught over having been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Behind">left behind</a> in such a callous manner, that he could do something drastic.</p>

<p>What WILL become of Mugsy?</p>
