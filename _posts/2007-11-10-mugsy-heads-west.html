<p>When we <a href="http://shallowthoughts.org/2007/11/08/what-will-become-of-mugsy/">last saw Mugsy</a>, he was very sad. He had been abruptly separated from Eric. With harmonica in hand, Mugsy ventured forth from a <a href="http://www.tri-c.edu/home/default.htm">Tri-C</a> classroom and hopped a train west to seek adventure and fame after being forgotten by his former owner.</p>

<p>Since he's only a tiny mug, he couldn't close the boxcar door. So, when a strong gust of wind blew, Mugsy was tossed out. After he dusted himself off, a nice lady picked him up and took him to a magical place.</p>

<p>Mugsy had never heard of Tennessee before. He had to admit to himself that he was a little jealous the nice lady's jugs could hold more fluid than he can, but he was happy just to have company. The buxom blond gave Mugsy the grand tour of the Dixieland Amusement Park. They ate, they drank, they rode rides.</p>
<p>Mugsy recalled being on fun adventures with Eric, not unlike the one he was on now.</p>

<p>While he was daydreaming of his one true love, Mugsy was separated from his lady friend, just like he had been separated from Eric earlier. Alone once again, he decided to resume his pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Will Mugsy make it to Hollywood? Or will Mugsy bust?</p>
