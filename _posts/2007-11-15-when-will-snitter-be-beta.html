<p>When will <a href="http://snook.ca/archives/adobe_air/snitter_alpha/">Snitter</a> be moved from Alpha status to Beta status?  Is it just me, or does <a href="http://twitter.com/Snitter">Snitter</a> seem stable enough to Granted, Jonathan Snook's handy little widget isn't all that old, but it isn't like he's designing a <abbr title="Massive Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game">MMORPG</abbr> that will require years of development. So, you tell me...should <a href="http://flickr.com/search/?q=Snitter&amp;w=53573449%40N00">Snitter</a> still be an Alpha?</p>
