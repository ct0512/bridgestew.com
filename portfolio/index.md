    While employed at Voices for Ohio&#8217;s Children I worked with <a href="http://www.eyemg.com/cms/site/841df35d572b686e/index.html">Interactive Media Group</a> (Eyemg) to maintain the content for a state wide child advocacy organization.

I had the task of prompting the organization&#8217;s staff for content in each issue area as well as creating and distributing a bi-weekly newsletter (below). <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3021/2529292359_16fe547276_o.png" alt="Newsletter" width="475" height="300" />
