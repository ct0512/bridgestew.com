You&#8217;d think that when Twitter goes down, productivity would increase. Not so. In fact, productivity declines even more &#8211; evidenced by my refreshing [Down Right Now][1] repeatedly just so I will know when it is back up!

This is a trick I learned in playing video games. You go to any server status information outlet and refresh, refresh, refresh so you can be first back on the server. It&#8217;s hard to break certain habits&#8230;
