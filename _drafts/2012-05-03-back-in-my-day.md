Those of us who came into the Front End Development profession approximately 5 years ago had the ability to learn it in a much more stable environment, if you will. Mobile wasn&#8217;t a &#8220;thing&#8221; like it is now. CSS3 wasn&#8217;t a thing yet, it was just a dream we drooled over. Preprocessors weren&#8217;t a thing. Responsive Web Design wasn&#8217;t a thing. This field of study is so much broader with so many more considerations.

I know it can be argued that there was always a lot to learn or that the topics we consider &#8220;things&#8221; today were always important. We&#8217;re just more vividly aware of it now, thanks to device proliferation. Regardless, people coming into the Front End Development specialty today have so much more to grasp at the onset than we did 5 short years ago. I dare say we had it a little easier, even if IE6 made us cry bloody tears all the time.

And it isn&#8217;t going to get easier, imo.
