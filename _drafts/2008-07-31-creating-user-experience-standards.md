This month&#8217;s topic will focus on how big companies align site experiences for distinct but varied user groups. Nicole Capuana from Progressive Insurance will share the <span id=ntiio><a href=http://blogsbycity.com/lib/pet-vitamins/supplements-for-dog.html>supplements for dog</a></span>
process, challenges and outcome of their alignment effort.

It's customary for the CWSA to socialize a bit at 6:30 and allow time for stragglers and late comers to arrive. The presentation will begin promptly at 7:00 and end at 8:00. From there, those who have the time to spare, reconvene at [Max & Erma's][2] nearby (5020 Tiedeman Rd, Cleveland) to continue to discuss the topic of the evening, socialize and network with one another.

If you are free Tuesday evening, be sure to [RSVP on Upcoming][3]. We'd love to see you there!
