Ever stared at a blank Photoshop screen and just needed to “get started designing”? Ever been handed a 40 page spec sheet that you needed to build from? Ever wonder if this feature should even be built in the first place?<!--more-->

Not to be confused with usability testing – user research can help get client, designer and developer all on the same side of the table. A solid understanding of the user leads not only to true “usability” but even better ideas to build in the first place. With the right combination of tools and process – even designers and developers will demand user research with every project to the benefit of all.

Prior to that, Vince was an interaction designer and illustrator at Root Learning, Inc. After many years doing design and development, in 2005 he began designing a new form of organization that would enhance the user centered design and development process. In June of 2006, Sprokets launched as his own “ideal client” that would always align business strategy with end-user needs.
