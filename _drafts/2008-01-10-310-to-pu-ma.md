Hollywood doesn&#8217;t offer much in the way of movies that wow me anymore &#8212; at least, not in a positive way. I still love watching movies. I just find it few and far between that I watch a movie I love.

Tonight&#8217;s installment, a movie we borrowed from a friend, was [3:10 to Yuma][1], starring [Russell Crowe][2] (Ben Wade) and [Christian Bale][3] (Dan Evans). My husband and <span id=oxfu><a href=http://blogsbycity.com/lib/pet-vitamins/best-vitamins-for-dogs.html>best vitamins for dogs</a></span>  
I were watching it without our usual banter in which we mock stupid plot points or complain that the background music is drowning out the dialogue. That was until the movie comes to its climax. This movie wasn't great, but it didn't actually suck up until the end. Then, it fell apart and fell apart *fast*. I'm not going to go into spoilers or anything, but suffice it to say it became preposterous that events would have unfolded as they did.

Before seeing this film, I didn't realize that it was remake of a movie from 50 years ago starring Glenn Ford (Ben Wade) and Van Heflin (Dan Evans). I discovered that fact when I went to [IMDB][4] to find out why I recognized the actor who played Charlie ([Ben Foster][5]) in the current version. Upon learning that this movie was a *remake *I had to ask myself -- WHY?

Admittedly, I didn't see the 1957 version and sometimes creative liberties are taken when remaking a film. I can only hope that this is what happened and that it went horribly awry. Otherwise, I would like an explanation as to what prompts filmmakers to go with a story in which the plot crumbles a **second** time. Why go to **that** well? Moreover, what were Russell Crowe and Christian Bale thinking when they read the script?! Did they really get to the part where the climax begins (and sucks) and think, "Oh yeah! I gotta make this film." It's not like these two guys are hard up for work or anything.

Really, what is Hollywood thinking?
