Dear Mr. &#8220;[I&#8217;m bad at blog titles][1]&#8220;,

Not only are you bad at blog titles, you are bad at comprehending the progressive enhancement philosophy behind building websites/webapps.

Progressive enhancement doesn&#8217;t focus on catering to the least capable browser. It simply doesn&#8217;t exclude a less capable browser from providing access to all the content housed on the site. Progressive enhancement layers on various features in a responsible fashion in order to provide more capable browsers an &#8220;advanced&#8221; experience based on the technologies it supports.

The key principle of progressive enhancement is: Restrict no one from being able to get at the content they seek.

That doesn&#8217;t mean, make a crappy experience for all because of the lowest common denominator. Far from it.
