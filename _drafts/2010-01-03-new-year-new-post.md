A lot of posts in the first few days of January reflect on the year that passed and/or look toward the year ahead. That&#8217;s not my plan here. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with posts like that. I just don&#8217;t want to do one of those. I do, however, want to get back into writing. More specifically, engaging in conversations that may be more meaty than those we have on Twitter or Facebook.<!--more-->

### Why I&#8217;ve been rather silent

I&#8217;ve been very quiet on my blog over the last year: partly because I wasn&#8217;t sure I had anything of value to say, partly because I couldn&#8217;t motivate myself to complete a post even if a topic struck me. The lack of motivation stemmed from a feeling that anything I wanted to share has already been said, probably a thousand times before by people far more eloquent than I am.

[Anton Peck][1] revived his [Project52][2] endeavor which made me want to join in his crusade, but I can&#8217;t commit to the rules of the challenge. Outside of this noble quest by Anton and friends, I do want to have a reason to write more&#8230;so I got this idea to write about questions that I have about what I see happening on the web. That won&#8217;t necessarily give me something to write about once or twice a week, which is why I won&#8217;t be part of the Project52 brigade&#8230;but, it&#8217;s a start.

### What questions to expect

The questions I have are about experiences I have had while working on projects. Some may not necessarily apply to the web as a whole, just particular situations. Some others sound like scenarios I&#8217;ve heard other web professionals complain about, so I assume I&#8217;m not alone in these situations. It&#8217;s my hope that as I write about these questions, people will feel free to describe *how* they attempted to <span id=cfqoy><a href=http://blogsbycity.com/lib/pet-vitamins/pet-vitamins.html>pet vitamins</a></span>  
resolve a similar issue, rather than just providing the obligatory, "I feel your pain" comment. While it helps to know that I'm not the only one suffering under the weight of poor planning, bad decisions, worse course correction attempts, and working with people in positions of power who just don't "Get It," I'm more interested in the solutions people have tried to combat these issues.

I'm not only interested in the solutions that paid off, although I desperately want to hear them. I would also appreciate hearing the attempts at resolving these issues that didn't necessarily work out, because that can often provide insight as well. Learning from others mistakes is quite valuable, but it seems that failed attempts can be very close to a working solution, if only it were tweaked slightly based on environmental factors.

### In closing

Basically this means I will be writing more, but I hope it doesn't come across as long-winded complaining. I hope it will provide an opportunity to find solutions that I haven't tried, or just make me a better web professional in general.
